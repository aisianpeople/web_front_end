The internets physical body is wires and radio waves that travel 
between computers.  It also includes routers and the computers themselves.
There are also servers which are computers directly connected to the primary 
wires without any routers. The internet is comprised of smaller networks.

When looking for a website your computer sends out the request which then 
goes to a local DNS cache that if it knows where will respond to the computer 
with the location and the computer will then directly communicate with the website.
If the local DNS cache doesn't know it will then move up where it will repeat the 
process with the local router DNS, then the ISP DNS, then the internet where it 
will get the root DNS servers.  Once communicating it will send out packets that 
will move through the internet through routers and ISPs, each time putting an 
additional layer around it indicating where it came from. once recieved it will 
respond with the same layers unwrapping at the same locations till it reaches 
the original computer.
